## Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
- **Machine learning** is a growing technology which enables computers to learn automatically from past data. Machine learning uses various algorithms for building mathematical models and making predictions using historical data or information. Currently, it is being used for various tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, email filtering, Facebook auto-tagging, recommender system, and many more.

## Overview of model
- In this model, we will be predicting that whether the patient has diabetes or not on the basis of the features we will provide to our machine learning model.
- In this model **SVM** algorithm is used for prediction of diabetes patient.
- Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.

## Model building
- **Importing libraries**
- **Numpy** : NumPy stands for Numerical Python. NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

- **Pandas** : Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.
- 
- **Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in data analysis. It helps to understand the nature of the data and identify any patterns or trends hidden within it. We can gain insights into the data using various visualization techniques and statistical methods, which can help make informed decisions. <br>
In this model I have covered some essential techniques for performing EDA, such as summary statistics.
